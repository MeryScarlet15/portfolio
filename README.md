# Maria Amado | Full Stack Developer Portfolio

## About Me

I’m a passionate Full Stack Developer with over 6 years of experience, based in Spain. I have expertise in Next.js, Nest.js, Node.js, React, Typescript, and SEO, among other technologies. I give great importance to SEO, user experience, performance, and clean code. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, traveling, and working out.
