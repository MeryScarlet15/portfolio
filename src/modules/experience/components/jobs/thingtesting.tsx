        In my first year at Thingtesting, I contributed to multiple features
        across various projects, including the Next.js frontend, NestJS API, and
        Google Cloud Platform for seamless deployment and scalability. My focus
        was on performance optimization and building a scalable architecture.

        I have been using Cursor as my primary IDE and ChatGPT to further
        develop my skills, optimizing my workflow and improving my efficiency as
        a developer. I also implemented some features using the OpenAI API,
        introducing innovative functionality to enhance the product.

        In the last 4 months, I took on the responsibility of leading the SEO
        aspect of the product. I provided bi-weekly reports that tracked our
        progress and highlighted new insights about user behavior. These reports
        included SEO analysis and recommendations to increase impressions,
        clicks, and rankings. I focused on initiatives such as integrating our
        products with Google Merchant Center, optimizing content for Google
        Snippets, and enhancing Web Core Vitals to improve website performance.
