      <p>
        In my first year at Thingtesting, I contributed to multiple features
        across various projects, including the <span>Next.js</span> frontend,
        <span>NestJS</span> API, and <span>Google Cloud Platform</span> for
        seamless deployment and scalability. My focus was on performance
        optimization and building a scalable architecture.

      <p>
        I have been using <span>Cursor</span> as my primary IDE and{' '}
        <span>ChatGPT</span> to further develop my skills, optimizing my
        workflow and improving my efficiency as a developer. I also implemented
        some features using the <span>OpenAI</span> API, introducing innovative
        functionality to enhance the product.

        In the last 4 months, I took on the responsibility of leading the{' '}
        <span>SEO</span> aspect of the product. I provided bi-weekly reports
        that tracked our progress and highlighted new insights about user
        behavior. These reports included SEO analysis and recommendations to
        increase impressions, clicks, and rankings. I focused on initiatives
        such as integrating our products with Google Merchant Center, optimizing
        content for <span>Google Snippets</span>, and enhancing{' '}
        <span>Web Core Vitals</span> to improve website performance and user
        experience.
