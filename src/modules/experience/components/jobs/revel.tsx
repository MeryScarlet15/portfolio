        During my first year at Revel, I focused on frontend development,
        establishing a consistent code structure with hexagonal architecture for
        all frontend projects. The technologies I used included:

      <ul>
        <li>Next.js: To enable server-side rendering and improve SEO</li>
        <li>
          TypeScript: For better project maintainability and error detection
        </li>
        <li>HTML5: Ensuring proper use of HTML5 semantic tags</li>
        <li>
          Styled Components: For efficient styling and component-based design
        </li>
        <li>
          Storybook: To document and test UI components with React Testing
          Library
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In my second year, I expanded my role to include backend tasks such as
        API development, deployment, and utilizing AWS. On the backend, I worked
        with Express.js and continued using hexagonal architecture. I also
        improved frontend-backend communication by documenting all requests and
        their types using Postman and running automated tests on the requests.

        Additionally, I developed bots using JavaScript and handled ETL jobs
        with Python.
