        During my first year at Revel, I focused on frontend development,
        establishing a consistent code structure with{' '}
        <span>hexagonal architecture</span> for all frontend projects. The
        technologies I used included:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span>Next.js</span>: To enable server-side rendering and improve
            SEO
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span>TypeScript</span>: For better project maintainability and
            error detection
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>HTML5: Ensuring proper use of HTML5 semantic tags</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span>Styled Components</span>: For efficient styling and
            component-based design
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span>Storybook</span>: To document and test UI components with
            React Library
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In my second year, I expanded my role to include backend tasks such as
        API development, deployment, and utilizing <span>AWS</span>. On the
        backend, I worked with <span>Express.js</span> and continued using{' '}
        <span>hexagonal architecture</span>. I also improved frontend-backend
        communication by documenting all requests and their types using Postman
        and running automated tests on the requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, I developed bots using <span>JavaScript</span> and handled
        ETL jobs with <span>Python</span>.
